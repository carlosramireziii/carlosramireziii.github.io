## The existing admin gems just aren't cutting it

When it comes to admin interfaces, the most popular choice is Active Admin...
Unfortunately, many of us are becoming fatigued by AA.
Customizations using Arbe can grow pretty painful, 
especially if you don't have extensive knowledge of the documentation. 

Rails Admin, the second most popular choice, can be equally difficult to customize, 
and many find the Twitter Bootstrap dashboard design ugly.

Don't get me wrong: Active Admin and Rails Admin are far from unusable.
But when thoughtbot announced Administrate just over a year ago, 
the community was understandably excited to finally have an alternative worth looking in to.

## You're scared to try Administrate because it looks like abandonware

In mid-2016 it looked like Administrate was a dead project.
There hadn't been a release in several months, 
and there were piles of open issues and pull requests.
Someone even opened up [a GitHub issue](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate/issues/753) asking what the story was. 

No one wants to use a project that isn't being actively maintained,
especially when your clients will end up depending on it.

## Don't worry, Administrate is alive and well!

After looking into it, I am happy to report that **Administrate is not dead**.
The original maintainer left thoughtbot,
which required looking for a new person to carry the torch.

Not only does it look like there is a new maintainer, 
but there is also a new release coming possibly as early as this week.

I plan to follow this project closely.
