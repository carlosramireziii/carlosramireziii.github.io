## You don't have to do it alone

As an experienced programmer, business owner, and consultant, it gives me great joy to pass along the wisdom I've
gained throughout the years to others.

My measure of success as a mentor is how many mistakes I'm able to help you avoid... in that, I hope to be wildly successful.

Drop me a line by [email](contact@carlosramireziii.com) or booking a [one-on-one session](https://www.codementor.io/carlosramireziii).

Best,\\
